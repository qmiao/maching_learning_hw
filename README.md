The repository includes my implementation to some machine learning models:

- [ANN.py](https://github.com/qmiao/mlprojects/blob/master/src/ANN.py):
  An efficient implementation of Artificial Neural Networks using stochastic gradient descent algorithm, tested on the MNIST data set.
- [CNN.py](https://github.com/qmiao/mlprojects/blob/master/src/CNN.py):
  An efficient implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks using batch gradient descent algorithm, tested on the MNIST data set.
- [DT.py](https://github.com/qmiao/mlprojects/blob/master/src/DT.py):
  An implementation of Decision Tree Model using entropy and information gain, tested on the arrhythmia data set.
- [LR.py](https://github.com/qmiao/mlprojects/blob/master/src/LR.py):
  An implementation of Logistic Regression using batch gradient descent algorithm, and tested against scikit-learn's Logistic Regression model on the wdbc data set.
- [prudential.py](https://github.com/qmiao/mlprojects/blob/master/src/prudential.py):
  Steps taken to fit a Decision Tree model and a Logistic Regression model to the Prudential Life Insurance Assessment data, including techniques such as imputing missing values, generating dummy variables, plotting cross validation curves and learning curves.
