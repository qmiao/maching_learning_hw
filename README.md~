The repository includes my implementation to some data science projects:

- [ANN.py](https://github.com/qmiao/maching_learning_hw/blob/master/src/ANN.py):
  An implementation of Artificial Neural Networks and tested on the MNIST data set.
- [DT.py](https://github.com/qmiao/maching_learning_hw/blob/master/src/DT.py):
  An implementation of Decision Tree Model using entropy and information gain.
- [LR.py](https://github.com/qmiao/maching_learning_hw/blob/master/src/LR.py):
  An implementation of Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent, and tested against scikit-learn's Logistic Regression model
- [prudential.py](https://github.com/qmiao/maching_learning_hw/blob/master/src/prudential.py):
  Steps taken to fit a Decision Tree model and a Logistic Regression model to the Prudential Life Insurance Assessment data
